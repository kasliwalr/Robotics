This repository serves as a hub for robotics theory notes and starter projects. This is an evolving repository. The theory portions will be continually updated and improved and new material added. The starter projects are early stage projects without proper documentation and testing, once they reach maturity, they will be become their own repository, with only links to them available on this repository
