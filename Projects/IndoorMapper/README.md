# Indoor Mapper
This project details the design of an indoor mapper project. This is an ongoing project, and will add capabilities over time


## Requirements 

- mobile robot for indoor environment
- indoor environment - carpeted floor, wood, or other plan surface. furniture 
- 2D navigation
- autonomous navigation in pre generated mapped environments
- map generation capability 
- max speed of 1 m/sec
- rechargeable/non-rechargeable battery
- remote controlling capability through Bluetooth/Wifi
- data streaming capability
- range finding accuracy +/5 cm
- in-place 360 degree rotation
- enough space to add jetson TK1/TX1, raspberry Pi, 32-bit uC
- sleep/wake-up capability to conserve battey life


- Future capabilities: temperature sensing, voice recognition, facial recognition

## BOM

|Part Name|Qty|Unit Price ($)|Total Price ($)|
|---------|---|----------|-----------|
|Waffle Board|4|10.00|40.00|
|[Dynamixel XL430-W250-T](http://www.robotis.us/x-series/?price_min=0&price_max=82&sort=featured)|2|49.50|99.00|


## Notes
- are vision+encoder based sensing sufficient for localization in indoor environments
